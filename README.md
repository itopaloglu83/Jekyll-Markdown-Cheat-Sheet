# Jekyll-Markdown-Cheat-Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements that are supported by Jekyll.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use markup language for web writers. Markdown allows you to add formatting elements to plaintext documents and then convert them to structurally valid HTML.

Markdown syntax can be divided into two broad categories. These categories are (1) basic syntax outlined in the original design document and (2) extension of basic syntax for added capability and features.

Refer to [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more examples.

## Basic syntax

These elements are defined in the original Markdown design document and can be used in all Markdown applications.

Detailed information and examples can be fount at [basic syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
